# Perfect Smart Scalper

This code is a sample implementation of the Perfect Smart Scalper Forex robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to be used with the MetaTrader 5 platform and aims to optimize profit potential while minimizing potential losses in scalping strategies.

## How It Works

The code consists of several functions and a main function called `OnStart()`. Here is a breakdown of each function and its purpose:

### calculateRiskLevel(currencyPair)

This function calculates the risk level based on the back-tested performance of a given currency pair. It returns an integer value representing the risk level, which can be one of the following constants: `CONSERVATIVE_RISK`, `MODERATE_RISK`, or `AGGRESSIVE_RISK`.

### executeBuyOrder(currencyPair, volume)

This function executes a buy order for a given currency pair with a specified volume. It calculates the current price, stop-loss, and take-profit levels based on the current market conditions and places the order accordingly.

### executeSellOrder(currencyPair, volume)

This function executes a sell order for a given currency pair with a specified volume. Similar to the `executeBuyOrder()` function, it calculates the current price, stop-loss, and take-profit levels based on the current market conditions and places the order accordingly.

### setRiskType(type)

This function sets the risk type preference based on the input type. It updates the global variable `riskType` to the specified type, which can be one of the risk level constants.

### optimizeProfit()

This function implements the optimization logic to maximize profit potential while minimizing potential losses. The specific optimization strategy is not defined in the provided code and should be implemented by the user.

### handleErrors()

This function handles errors and exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code. The specific error handling logic is not defined in the provided code and should be implemented by the user.

### retrieveMarketData()

This function retrieves real-time market data using a data feed. The specific implementation of the data feed logic is not defined in the provided code and should be implemented by the user.

### calculatePerformanceMetrics()

This function calculates and displays performance metrics based on the executed trades. The specific calculation and display logic is not defined in the provided code and should be implemented by the user.

### manageOpenPositions()

This function manages open positions, including monitoring and adjusting stop-loss and take-profit levels. The specific management logic is not defined in the provided code and should be implemented by the user.

### createUserInterface()

This function creates a user-friendly interface for the Forex robot. The specific implementation of the user interface logic is not defined in the provided code and should be implemented by the user.

### testCode()

This function tests the code to ensure its functionality and performance. The specific testing logic is not defined in the provided code and should be implemented by the user.

### optimizeCodePerformance()

This function optimizes the code performance to improve its efficiency and speed. The specific optimization logic is not defined in the provided code and should be implemented by the user.

### ensureCodeSecurity()

This function ensures the code's security by implementing appropriate security measures. The specific security logic is not defined in the provided code and should be implemented by the user.

### collaborateWithProductTeam()

This function facilitates collaboration with the product team for further development and enhancements of the Forex robot. The specific collaboration logic is not defined in the provided code and should be implemented by the user.

### provideSupportAndMaintenance()

This function provides ongoing support and maintenance for the Forex robot. The specific support and maintenance logic is not defined in the provided code and should be implemented by the user.

### OnStart()

This is the main function that executes the trading logic based on the calculated risk level. It sets the risk type preference, executes buy and sell orders, optimizes profit potential, handles errors and exceptions, retrieves market data, calculates performance metrics, manages open positions, creates a user-friendly interface, tests the code, optimizes code performance, ensures code security, collaborates with the product team, and provides ongoing support and maintenance.
